Current Status (Sep 2, 2017): Version 3.11b for Mac OS X and Linux have been used heavily for about a year including many students who are running it on a variety of machines now.

Version 3.11d (Windows only) was just created Sep 2 because 3.11b does not run on Windows 10. I do not know why. Ver. 3.11d is the same as Ver. 3.11b, except the download is compiled using Visual Studio Community 2017 on a Win 10 machine. It was tested on Win 10 and Win 7.

(Version 3.11c had an installer problem and has been removed.)

If you have any problems, please email direct to rbd at cs.cmu.edu.
