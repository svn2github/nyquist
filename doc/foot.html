<a name = "foot1"> 1. </a>Most behaviors will stop at time 1, warped according to <code>*warp*</code> to some real time, but this is by convention and is not a direct specification.
<P>
<a name = "foot2"> 2. </a>Since XLisp does not support multiple value returns, multiple value returns are simulated by having the function assign additional return values in a list to the global variable <code>*rslt*</code>. Since this is a global, it should be inspected or copied immediately after the function return to insure that return values are not overwritten by another function.
<P>
<a name = "foot3"> 3. </a>This is not a standard XLisp 2.0 function.
