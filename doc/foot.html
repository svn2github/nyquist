<a name = "foot1"> 1. </a>In the Common Music implementation of SAL, <code>=</code> compiles to the Lisp <code>=</code> function, so this is an incompatible difference.

<a name = "foot2"> 2. </a>In the Common Music implementation of SAL, <code>~=</code> compiles to the Lisp <code>equal</code> function, so this is an incompatible difference.

<a name = "foot3"> 3. </a>Most behaviors will stop at time 1, warped according to <code>*warp*</code> to some real time, but this is by convention and is not a direct specification.
<P>
<a name = "foot4"> 4. </a>Since XLISP does not support multiple value
returns, multiple value returns are simulated by having the function
assign additional return values in a list to the global
variable <code>*rslt*</code>. Since this is a global, it should be inspected
or copied immediately after the function return to insure that return
values are not overwritten by another function.
<P>
