<a name = "82"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
        XLISP is an experimental programming language combining some of
        the features of Common Lisp with an object-oriented extension
        capability.  It was implemented to allow experimentation with
        object-oriented programming on small computers.
<p>
        There are currently implementations of XLISP running on the IBM-
        PC and clones under MS-DOS, on the Macintosh, the Atari-ST and
        the Amiga.  It is completely written in the programming language
        C and is easily extended with user written built-in functions
        and classes.  It is available in source form to non-commercial
        users.
<p>
        Many Common Lisp functions are built into XLISP.  In addition,
        XLISP defines the objects Object and Class as primitives.
        Object is the only class that has no superclass and hence is
        the root of the class hierarchy tree.  Class is the class of
        which all classes are instances (it is the only object that is
        an instance of itself).
<p>
        This document is a brief description of XLISP.  It assumes some
        knowledge of LISP and some understanding of the concepts of
        object-oriented programming.
<p>
        I recommend the book <i>Lisp</i> by Winston and Horn and published by
        Addison Wesley for learning Lisp.  The first edition of this
        book is based on MacLisp and the second edition is based on
        Common Lisp.  XLISP will continue to migrate towards
        compatibility with Common Lisp.
<p>
        You will probably also need a copy of <i>Common Lisp: The
        Language</i> by Guy L. Steele, Jr., published by Digital Press to
        use as a reference for some of the Common Lisp functions that
        are described only briefly in this document.
<p>
        <a name = "83"><h3>A Note From The Author</h3></a>        If you have any problems with XLISP, feel free to contact me [me being David Betz - RBD] for
        help or advice.  Please remember that since XLISP is available
        in source form in a high level language, many users [e.g. that Dannenberg fellow - RBD] have been
        making versions available on a variety of machines.  If you call
        to report a problem with a specific version, I may not be able
        to help you if that version runs on a machine to which I don't
        have access.  Please have the version number of the version that
        you are running readily accessible before calling me.
<p>
        If you find a bug in XLISP, first try to fix the bug yourself
        using the source code provided.  If you are successful in fixing
        the bug, send the bug report along with the fix to me.  If you
        don't have access to a C compiler or are unable to fix a bug,
        please send the bug report to me and I'll try to fix it.
<p>
        Any suggestions for improvements will be welcomed.  Feel free to
        extend the language in whatever way suits your needs.  However,
        PLEASE DO NOT RELEASE ENHANCED VERSIONS WITHOUT CHECKING WITH ME
        FIRST!!  I would like to be the clearing house for new features
        added to XLISP.  If you want to add features for your own
        personal use, go ahead.  But, if you want to distribute your
        enhanced version, contact me first.  Please remember that the
        goal of XLISP is to provide a language to learn and experiment
        with LISP and object-oriented programming on small computers.  I
        don't want it to get so big that it requires megabytes of memory
        to run.
<p>
        <a name = "84"><h3>XLISP Command Loop</h3></a><a name="index488"><a name="index489">        When XLISP is started, it first tries to load the workspace
        <code>xlisp.wks</code> from the current directory.  If that file doesn't
        exist, XLISP builds an initial workspace, empty except for the
        built-in functions and symbols.
<p>
        Then XLISP attempts to load <code>init.lsp</code> from the current
        directory.  It then loads any files named as parameters on the
        command line (after appending <code>.lsp</code> to their names).
<p>
        XLISP then issues the following prompt:
<pre>
        &gt
</pre>

        This indicates that XLISP is waiting for an expression to be
        typed.
<p>
        When a complete expression has been entered, XLISP attempts to
        evaluate that expression.  If the expression evaluates
        successfully, XLISP prints the result and then returns to the
        initial prompt waiting for another expression to be typed.
<p>
        <a name = "85"><h3>Break Command Loop</h3></a><a name="index490">        When XLISP encounters an error while evaluating an expression,
        it attempts to handle the error in the following way:
<p>
        If the symbol <code>*breakenable*<a name="index491"></code> is true, the message corresponding
        to the error is printed.  If the error is correctable, the
        correction message is printed.
<p>
        If the symbol <code>*tracenable*<a name="index492"></code> is true, a trace back is printed.
        The number of entries printed depends on the value of the symbol
        <code>*tracelimit*<a name="index493"></code>.  If this symbol is set to something other than a
        number, the entire trace back stack is printed.
<p>
        XLISP then enters a read/eval/print loop to allow the user to
        examine the state of the interpreter in the context of the
        error.  This loop differs from the normal top-level
        read/eval/print loop in that if the user invokes the function
        <code>continue</code>, XLISP will continue from a correctable error.  If
        the user invokes the function <code>clean-up</code>, XLISP will abort the
        break loop and return to the top level or the next lower
        numbered break loop.  When in a break loop, XLISP prefixes the
        break level to the normal prompt.
<p>
        If the symbol <code>*breakenable*<a name="index494"></code> is <code>nil</code>, XLISP looks for a
        surrounding errset function.  If one is found, XLISP examines
        the value of the print flag.  If this flag is true, the error
        message is printed.  In any case, XLISP causes the errset
        function call to return <code>nil</code>.
<p>
        If there is no surrounding errset function, XLISP prints the
        error message and returns to the top level.
<p>
        <a name = "86"><h3>Data Types</h3></a><a name="index495"><a name="index496">        There are several different data types available to XLISP
        programmers.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
lists
<li>symbols
<li>strings
<li>integers
<li>characters
<li>floats
<li>objects
<li>arrays
<li>streams
<li>subrs (built-in functions)
<li>fsubrs (special forms)
<li>closures (user defined functions)
</ul>
<p>
<a name = "87"><h3>The Evaluator</h3></a><a name="index497"><a name="index498">        The process of evaluation in XLISP:
<ul>
<li>
        Strings, integers, characters, floats, objects, arrays, streams,
        subrs, fsubrs and closures evaluate to themselves.
<li>        Symbols act as variables and are evaluated by retrieving the
        value associated with their current binding.
<li>        Lists are evaluated by examining the first element of the list
        and then taking one of the following actions:
<ul>
<li>
            If it is a symbol, the functional binding of the symbol is
            retrieved.
<li>            If it is a lambda expression, a closure is constructed for
            the function described by the lambda expression.
<li>            If it is a subr, fsubr or closure, it stands for itself.
<li>            Any other value is an error.
</ul>
        Then, the value produced by the previous step is examined:
<ul>
<li>
            If it is a subr or closure, the remaining list elements are
            evaluated and the subr or closure is called with these
            evaluated expressions as arguments.
<li>            If it is an fsubr, the fsubr is called using the remaining
            list elements as arguments (unevaluated).
<li>            If it is a macro, the macro is expanded using the remaining
            list elements as arguments (unevaluated).  The macro
            expansion is then evaluated in place of the original macro
            call.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<a name = "88"><h3>Lexical Conventions</h3></a><a name="index499"><a name="index500">        The following conventions must be followed when entering XLISP
        programs:
<p>
        Comments in XLISP code begin with a semi-colon character and
        continue to the end of the line.
<p>
        Symbol names in XLISP can consist of any sequence of non-blank
        printable characters except the following:
<pre>
                ( ) ' ` , " ;
</pre>

        Uppercase and lowercase characters are not distinguished within
        symbol names.  All lowercase characters are mapped to uppercase
        on input.
<p>
        Integer literals consist of a sequence of digits optionally
        beginning with a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>.  The range of values an integer can
        represent is limited by the size of a C <code>long</code> on the machine on
        which XLISP is running.
<p>
        Floating point literals consist of a sequence of digits
        optionally beginning with a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> and including an embedded
        decimal point.  The range of values a floating point number can
        represent is limited by the size of a C <code>float</code> (<code>double</code> on
        machines with 32 bit addresses) on the machine on which XLISP is
        running.
<p>
        Literal strings are sequences of characters surrounded by double
        quotes.  Within quoted strings the ``<code>\</code>'' character is used to
        allow non-printable characters to be included.  The codes
        recognized are:
<ul>
<li>
<code>\\</code>        means the character ``<code>\</code>''
<li><code>\n</code>      means newline
<li><code>\t</code>       means tab
<li><code>\r</code>       means return
<li><code>\f</code>       means form feed
<li><code>\nnn</code>    means the character whose octal code is nnn
</ul>
<p>
<a name = "89"><h3>Readtables</h3></a><a name="index501">        The behavior of the reader is controlled by a data structure
        called a <i>readtable</i>.  The reader uses the symbol <code>*readtable*<a name="index502"></code> to
        locate the current readtable.  This table controls the
        interpretation of input characters.  It is an array with 128
        entries, one for each of the ASCII character codes.  Each entry
        contains one of the following things:
<ul>
<li>
                <code>NIL</code> -          Indicating an invalid character
<li>                <code>:CONSTITUENT</code> -   Indicating a symbol constituent
<li>                <code>:WHITE-SPACE</code>  -  Indicating a whitespace character
<li>                <code>(:TMACRO . <i>fun</i>)</code> - Terminating readmacro
<li>                <code>(:NMACRO . <i>fun</i>)</code> - Non-terminating readmacro
<li>                <code>:SESCAPE</code> -       Single escape character ('\')
<li>                <code>:MESCAPE</code> -       Multiple escape character ('|')
</ul>
<p>
        In the case of <code>:TMACRO</code> and <code>:NMACRO</code>, the <i>fun</i> component is a
        function.  This can either be a built-in readmacro function or a
        lambda expression.  The function should take two parameters.
        The first is the input stream and the second is the character
        that caused the invocation of the readmacro.  The readmacro
        function should return <code>NIL</code> to indicate that the character should
        be treated as white space or a value consed with <code>NIL</code> to indicate
        that the readmacro should be treated as an occurence of the
        specified value.  Of course, the readmacro code is free to read
        additional characters from the input stream.
<p>
        XLISP defines several useful read macros:
<ul>
<li>
                '<i>&ltexpr&gt</i>         == (quote <i>&ltexpr&gt</i>)
<li>                #'<i>&ltexpr&gt</i>        == (function <i>&ltexpr&gt</i>)
<li>                #(<i>&ltexpr&gt</i>...)    == an array of the specified expressions
<li>                #x<i>&lthdigits&gt</i>     == a hexadecimal number (0-9,A-F)
<li>                #o<i>&ltodigits&gt</i>     == an octal number (0-7)
<li>                #b<i>&ltbdigits&gt</i>     == a binary number (0-1)
<li>                #\<i>&ltchar&gt</i> == the ASCII code of the character
<li>                #| ... |#       == a comment
<li>                #:<i>&ltsymbol&gt</i>      == an uninterned symbol
<li>                `<i>&ltexpr&gt</i>         == (backquote <i>&ltexpr&gt</i>)
<li>                ,<i>&ltexpr&gt</i>         == (comma <i>&ltexpr&gt</i>)
<li>                ,@<i>&ltexpr&gt</i>        == (comma-at <i>&ltexpr&gt</i>)
<li></ul>
<a name = "90"><h3>Lambda Lists</h3></a><a name="index503">        There are several forms in XLISP that require that a ``lambda
        list'' be specified.  A lambda list is a definition of the
        arguments accepted by a function.  There are four different
        types of arguments.
<p>
        The lambda list starts with required arguments.  Required
        arguments must be specified in every call to the function.
<p>
        The required arguments are followed by the &ampoptional arguments.
        Optional arguments may be provided or omitted in a call.  An
        initialization expression may be specified to provide a default
        value for an &ampoptional argument if it is omitted from a call.
        If no initialization expression is specified, an omitted
        argument is initialized to <code>NIL</code>.  It is also possible to provide
        the name of a <code>supplied-p</code> variable that can be used to
        determine if a call provided a value for the argument or if the
        initialization expression was used.  If specified, the supplied-
        p variable will be bound to T if a value was specified in the
        call and <code>NIL</code> if the default value was used.
<p>
        The &ampoptional arguments are followed by the &amprest argument.  The
        &amprest argument gets bound to the remainder of the argument list
        after the required and &ampoptional arguments have been removed.
<p>
        The &amprest argument is followed by the &ampkey arguments.  When a
        keyword argument is passed to a function, a pair of values
        appears in the argument list.  The first expression in the pair
        should evaluate to a keyword symbol (a symbol that begins with a
        ``<code>:</code>'').  The value of the second expression is the value of the
        keyword argument.  Like &ampoptional arguments, &ampkey arguments can
        have initialization expressions and supplied-p variables.  In
        addition, it is possible to specify the keyword to be used in a
        function call.  If no keyword is specified, the keyword obtained
        by adding a ``<code>:</code>'' to the beginning of the keyword argument symbol
        is used.  In other words, if the keyword argument symbol is
        <code>foo</code>, the keyword will be <code>':foo</code>.
<p>
        The &ampkey arguments are followed by the &ampaux variables.  These
        are local variables that are bound during the evaluation of the
        function body.  It is possible to have initialization
        expressions for the &ampaux variables.
<p>
    Here is the complete syntax for lambda lists:
<blockquote>
                (<i>rarg</i>...<br>

                 [&ampoptional [<i>oarg</i> | (<i>oarg</i> [<i>init</i> [<i>svar</i>]])]...]<br>

                 [&amprest <i>rarg</i>]<br>

                 [&ampkey<br>

                   [<i>karg</i> | ([<i>karg</i> | (<i>key</i> <i>karg</i>)] [<i>init</i> [<i>svar</i>]])]...<br>

                   &ampallow-other-keys]<br>

                 [&ampaux<br>

                   [<i>aux</i> | (<i>aux</i> [<i>init</i>])]...])
<p>
            where:
<p>
                <i>rarg</i> is a required argument symbol<br>

                <i>oarg</i> is an &ampoptional argument symbol<br>

                <i>rarg</i> is the &amprest argument symbol<br>

                <i>karg</i> is a &ampkey argument symbol<br>

                <i>key</i> is a keyword symbol<br>

                <i>aux</i> is an auxiliary variable symbol<br>

                <i>init</i> is an initialization expression<br>

                <i>svar</i> is a supplied-p variable symbol<br>

</blockquote>

<a name = "91"><h3>Objects</h3></a><a name="index504">        Definitions:
<ul>
<li>
selector - a symbol used to select an appropriate method
<li>message - a selector and a list of actual arguments
<li>method - the code that implements a message
</ul>
        Since XLISP was created to provide a simple basis for
        experimenting with object-oriented programming, one of the
        primitive data types included is <i>object</i>.  In XLISP, an object
        consists of a data structure containing a pointer to the
        object's class as well as an array containing the values of the
        object's instance variables.
<p>
        Officially, there is no way to see inside an object (look at the
        values of its instance variables).  The only way to communicate
        with an object is by sending it a message.
<p>
        You can send a message to an object using the <code>send</code> function.
        This function takes the object as its first argument, the
        message selector as its second argument (which must be a symbol)
        and the message arguments as its remaining arguments.
<p>
        The <code>send</code> function determines the class of the receiving object
        and attempts to find a method corresponding to the message
        selector in the set of messages defined for that class.  If the
        message is not found in the object's class and the class has a
        super-class, the search continues by looking at the messages
        defined for the super-class.  This process continues from one
        super-class to the next until a method for the message is found.
        If no method is found, an error occurs.
<p>
        A message can also be sent from the body of a method by using
        the current object, but the method lookup starts with the
        object's superclass rather than its class.  This allows a
        subclass to invoke a standard method in its parent class even
        though it overrides that method with its own specialized
        version.
<p>
        When a method is found, the evaluator binds the receiving object
        to the symbol <code>self</code> and evaluates the method using the
        remaining elements of the original list as arguments to the
        method.  These arguments are always evaluated prior to being
        bound to their corresponding formal arguments.  The result of
        evaluating the method becomes the result of the expression.

        When a new instance of a class is created by sending the message
        <code>:new</code> to an existing class, the message <code>:isnew</code> followed by
        whatever parameters were passed to the <code>:new</code> message is sent to
        the newly created object.
<p>
        When a new class is created by sending the <code>:new</code> message to the
        object <code>Class</code>, an optional parameter may be specified
        indicating the superclass of the new class.  If this parameter
        is omitted, the new class will be a subclass of <code>Object</code>.  A
        class inherits all instance variables, class variables, and
        methods from its super-class.

The Xlisp 2.0 release has been extended with a profiling facility, which counts how many times and where <code>eval</code> is executed.  A separate count is maintained for each named function, closure, or macro, and a count indicates an <code>eval</code> in the immediately (lexically) enclosing named function, closure, or macro.  Thus, the count gives an indication of the amount of time spent in a function, not counting nested function calls.  The list of all functions executed is maintained on the global <code>*profile*</code> variable.  These functions in turn have <code>*profile*</code> properties, which maintain the counts.  The profile system merely increments counters and puts symbols on the <code>*profile*</code> list.  It is up to the user to initialize data and gather results.  Profiling is turned on or off with the <code>profile</code> function.  Unfortunately, methods cannot be profiled with this facility.

        There are several symbols maintained by the read/eval/print
        loop.  The symbols <code>+</code>, <code>++</code>, and <code>+++</code> are bound to the most
        recent three input expressions.  The symbols <code>*</code>, <code>**</code> and <code>***</code>
        are bound to the most recent three results.  The symbol <code>-</code> is
        bound to the expression currently being evaluated.  It becomes
        the value of <code>+</code> at the end of the evaluation.

Note: Under Windows, Nyquist normally starts up in a medium-sized console window with black text and a white background, with a window title of ``Nyquist.'' This is normally accomplished by calling <code>setup-console</code> in <code>system.lsp</code>. In Nyquist, you can avoid this behavior by setting <code>*setup-console*</code> to NIL in your <code>init.lsp</code> file. If <code>setup-console</code> is not called, Nyquist uses standard input and output as is. This is what you want if you are running Nyquist inside of emacs, for example.<a name="index817"><br>

</dl><a name = "116"><h3>File I/O Functions</h3></a><a name="index818"><a name = "117"><h4>Input from a File</h4></a><a name="index819">To open a file for input, use the <code>open</code> function with the keyword
argument <code>:direction</code> set to <code>:input</code>.  To open a file for output,
use the <code>open</code> function with the keyword argument <code>:direction</code> set
to <code>:output</code>.  The <code>open</code> function takes a single required argument which
is the name of the file to be opened.  This name can be in the form of a
string or a symbol.  The <code>open</code> function returns an object of type
<code>FILE-STREAM</code> if it succeeds in opening the specified file.  It returns the
value <code>nil</code> if it fails.  In order to manipulate the file, it is
necessary to save the value returned by the <code>open</code> function.  This is
usually done by assigning it to a variable with the <code>setq</code> special form or by
binding it using <code>let</code> or <code>let*</code>.  Here is an example:
<pre>
(setq fp (open "init.lsp" :direction :input))
</pre>

        Evaluating this expression will result in the file <code>init.lsp</code>
        being opened.  The file object that will be returned by the <code>open</code>
        function will be assigned to the variable <code>fp</code>.
<p>
        It is now possible to use the file for input.  To read an
        expression from the file, just supply the value of the <code>fp</code>
        variable as the optional <i>stream</i> argument to <code>read</code>.
<pre>
(read fp)
</pre>

        Evaluating this expression will result in reading the first
        expression from the file <code>init.lsp</code>.  The expression will be
        returned as the result of the <code>read</code> function.  More expressions
        can be read from the file using further calls to the <code>read</code>
        function.  When there are no more expressions to read, the <code>read</code>
        function will return <code>nil</code> (or whatever value was supplied as the
        second argument to <code>read</code>).
<p>
        Once you are done reading from the file, you should close it.
        To close the file, use the following expression:
<pre>
(close fp)
</pre>

        Evaluating this expression will cause the file to be closed.
<p>
<a name = "118"><h4>Output to a File</h4></a><a name="index820">        Writing to a file is pretty much the same as reading from one.
        You need to open the file first.  This time you should use the
        <code>open</code> function to indicate that you will do output to the file.
        For example:
<pre>
(setq fp (open "test.dat" :direction :output))
</pre>

        Evaluating this expression will open the file <code>test.dat</code> for
        output.  If the file already exists, its current contents will
        be discarded.  If it doesn't already exist, it will be created.
        In any case, a <code>FILE-STREAM</code> object will be returned by the <code>OPEN</code>
        function.  This file object will be assigned to the <code>fp</code>
        variable.
<p>
        It is now possible to write to this file by supplying the value
        of the <code>fp</code> variable as the optional <i>stream</i> parameter in the  <code>print</code> function.
<pre>
(print "Hello there" fp)
</pre>

        Evaluating this expression will result in the string ``Hello
        there'' being written to the file <code>test.dat</code>.  More data can be
        written to the file using the same technique.
<p>
        Once you are done writing to the file, you should close it.
        Closing an output file is just like closing an input file.
<pre>
(close fp)
</pre>

        Evaluating this expression will close the output file and make
        it permanent.

<a name = "119"><h4>A Slightly More Complicated File Example</h4></a>        This example shows how to open a file, read each Lisp expression
        from the file and print it.  It demonstrates the use of files
        and the use of the optional <i>stream</i> argument to the <code>read</code>
        function.
<pre>
(do* ((fp (open "test.dat" :direction :input))
      (ex (read fp) (read fp)))
     ((null ex) nil)
  (print ex))
</pre>
