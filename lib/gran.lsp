;; GRAN.LSP -- granular synthesis example by Roger B. Dannenberg
;;
;; This is not the ultimate granular synthesis package, so do not
;; consider this to be a stable, permanent addition to the Nyquist
;; library. You can use it as is, or use it as the basis for your
;; own custom variations.

;; ==================================================================
;; Grains are windowed with "raised cosine pulse functions." These
;; are smooth envelopes based on the function (1-cos(2*pi*t))/2.
;; To speed up computation, I save three functions with 20, 200, and
;; 2205 samples. The function one-minus-cosine selects an appropriate
;; envelope based on the duration (stretch) currently in effect.

(defun cos-pulse () (scale 0.5 (sum 1 (lfo 1 1 *sine-table* 270.0))))

;; this will be a 2205 point smooth 1-cos(x) curve:
;;
(setf *cos-pulse-2205* (cos-pulse))

;; this will be a 200 point smooth 1-cos(x) curve:
;;
(setf *cos-pulse-200* (control-srate-abs 200 (cos-pulse)))
(setf *cos-pulse-20*  (control-srate-abs 20 (cos-pulse)))


;; one-minus-cosine -- an envelope based on (1-cos(2pi*t))/2
;;
(defun one-minus-cosine ()
  (let ((max-samps (* *sound-srate* (get-duration 1))))
    (cond ((> max-samps 2205) (sound *cos-pulse-2205*))
          ((> max-samps 200) (sound *cos-pulse-200*))
          (t (sound *cos-pulse-20*)))))

'  (let ((duration (get-duration 1)))
    (scale 0.5 (sum 1 (lfo (/ duration) 1 *sine-table* 270.0))))

;; ==================================================================
;; The granulation is applied to a sound file rather than a sound.
;; This gives us the ability to access the sound file at any point
;; in time, although is is a bit less efficient because we have to
;; reopen the file hundreds or thousands of times. (On the other hand
;; the file data is likely to be cached by the OS, so it goes pretty
;; fast.)
;; Here, we define some functions for getting file information.
