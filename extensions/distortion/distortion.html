<h2>Usage:</h2>
In SAL mode:
<blockquote>
<pre>
load "distortion/distort"
exec distortion-demo() 
distort(snd) - apply distortion to snd. The larger the amplitude of
  snd, the greater the effect. The snd amplitude may exceed 1, but the
  output will always be between -1 and 1.
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <h2> Terminology</h2>
    First, some terminology:
    <blockquote><i>Clipping</i> means that you limit the amplitude of
      samples, e.g.
      <p>sample_out = min(sample_in, 1.0),</p>
    </blockquote>
    or, observing that you might want to limit negative excursions as
    well as positive ones:
    <blockquote>sample_out = max(min(sample_in, 1.0), -1.0).</blockquote>
    This type of clipping is called <i>hard clipping</i> because the
    transition from an undistorted one to a maximum or minimum value is
    instantaneous, as if the signal hit a brick wall and can go no more.
    <p>As you might guess, you can also have <i>soft clipping</i> where
      the transition is more gradual, and that's what this tutorial is
      about. </p>
    <p>Before discussing soft clipping, let's introduce a few other
      terms. Since <i>clipping</i> seems to be a way of <i>limiting</i>
      the values of the signal or <i>compressing</i> the range of the
      signal, you might think that clipping is a form of compressing or
      limiting; however, these terms have special meanings in the audio
      processing world. </p>
    <blockquote><i>Compression</i>, or <i>dynamics compression</i> (not
      to be confused with <i>data compression</i>) is a way of reducing
      the overall range of soft to loud.</blockquote>
    To do dynamics compression, you generally detect the intensity or
    peak level of a sound over a time scale of a few milliseconds, and
    then construct a relatively smooth amplitude control that you apply
    to the signal. For compression, the amplification goes down as the
    intensity of the input goes up, so loud passages get (relatively)
    softer and soft passages get (relatively) louder. (Dynamics
    expansion does just the opposite.) <i>Limiters</i> work like
    compressors, but are designed to eliminate peaks -- conceptually,
    there is no real difference, and products are often sold as
    "compressor/limiters". See nyquist/lib/compress.lsp for an
    implementation.
    <p>In some ways, soft clipping is like dynamics compression. Both
      reduce the gain at high levels, but dynamics compression operates
      relatively slowly, effectively turning the volume knob up and
      down, whereas clipping operates on a sample-by-sample basis. <i>The
      effect of clipping is to distort the input.</i></p>
    <p>In Nyquist, you use the <tt>shape</tt> function to implement
      clipping. <tt>shape</tt> applies a function to each sample, where
      the function is specified by a sound. The following is a typical
      function for soft clipping: </p>
    <center><img src="softclip.jpg"></center>
    Notice how the function is essentially y=x at small amplitudes, so
    there is no distortion for small signals, but at large input values,
    the function becomes very non-linear. Also, notice that this is
    similar to the behavior of real-life amplifiers, where small signals
    are undistorted, but at some point, the power limits of the
    amplifier clip the output signal.
    <p>The Nyquist <tt>shape</tt> function is allows you to specify any
      function you like using a sound. Therefore you can use any of the
      Nyquist primitives to construct the function. Since a sound is a
      function of time, where time must be non-negative, how do you
      specify a shape function over a range that includes negative
      values? The trick is that <tt>shape</tt> takes an <i>offset</i>
      parameter that shifts the whole function to the left (in the -y
      direction). Note also that whereas a Nyquist sound is generally
      regarded as a function of time, <tt>shape</tt> treats the sound
      as just a real-valued function. </p>
    <p>The typical way to use shape is to create some increasing signal
      over the interval [0,2] that crosses zero at 1.0. Then you give
      1.0 as the offset (3rd parameter). The result will look something
      like the graph above. </p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    In the figure above, I used a sine function to generate the smooth
    curve. Here is an implementation of distortion in Nyquist using the
    sine curve:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(setf distortion 
      (osc (hz-to-step 0.25) 2.01 *SINE-TABLE* -90.0))
(defun distort (snd)
    (shape snd distortion 1.0)) 

(play (distort (mult 15.0 (ramp 4) (osc c4 4))))</pre>
      <p>Or in SAL,</p>
      <pre>set distortion =
      osc(hz-to-step(0.25), 2.01, *SINE-TABLE*, -90.0)
function distort(snd)<br>  return shape(snd, distortion, 1.0) 

play distort(15.0 * ramp(4) * osc(c4, 4))</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though I am an expert, and I have done this before, it still
      took me a few tries to get right. Here's a step-by-step
      explanation: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I used <tt>osc</tt> (line 2) to generate a sinusoid so I could control
        the initial phase. </li>
      <li>I set the osc duration to 2 because I want the table to go
        from 0 to 2 (after which we'll shift it back to [-1, +1]), but 2
        is not enough because the interval [0,2] is closed, which means
        I need one extra sample. I used 2.01 to be conservative. </li>
      <li>I specified <tt>*SINE-TABLE*</tt> (line 2), the default value, because
        the table parameter comes before the phase parameter. </li>
      <li>I specified the phase of -90 (line 2) to get the sine curve to go through zero
        in the <i>middle</i> of the generated function. </li>
      <li>I assigned this to the variable <tt>distortion</tt> so I could plot it;
        try:
        <pre>(s-plot (force-srate 100 distortion))</pre>
or in SAL:
<pre>plot force-srate(100, distortion)</pre></li>
      <li>Finally, I put in a tone that ramps up from zero to 15 in
        amplitude to cause some serious clipping. The output amplitude
        is limited to 1. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the input to <tt>shape</tt> is pre-clipped to the
      range [-1, +1] so you only need to specify the table from [0, 2]
      if the origin (third parameter to <tt>shape</tt>) is 1.0. If you
      specify a little extra, as in this example, it will be ignored. </p>
    <h2>The Output</h2>
    <p> Look at the generated waveform to observe the soft clipping
      effect. Here we see the beginning of the output, where the input
      amplitude is low and there is very little distortion: </p>
    <p> </p>
    <center> <img src="beginclip.jpg"> </center>
    But when the input amplitude becomes large, the clipping becomes
    substantial. This plot is at the same scale, but taken from a later
    portion of the generated output. Remember that the input at this
    point is a high-amplitude sinusoid:
    <p> </p>
    <center> <img src="largeclip.jpg"> </center>
    Also notice that the distortion is symetrical, so it generates even
    harmonics. If you put in an asymetric function, you'll get odd
    harmonics too. Note that at soft levels, I actually get some gain
    from this function.

    <h2>Demo</h2>
    You can run the following (in SAL mode) to run a small
    demonstration included in <code>distort.sal</code>. The first
    sound is a sine tone with increasing amplitude as shown in the
    images above. This is followed by a piano tone sequence where the
    amplitude is scaled by a ramp from 0 to 12 and then fed into the
    <code>distort</code> function. Two-note chords are used because
    the effect of distortion is much greater on a mix of tones than on
    single tones. This is because when you distort a single harmonic
    tone, you just generate additional harmonics, but when you distort
    a mix of tones, you get new inharmonic frequencies.
