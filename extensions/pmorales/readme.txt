Here there are a few sounds for Nyquist that
I have coded for learning. Mostly are based
on examples from Amsterdam Catalogue of
CSound Computer Instruments,and some others
are based on Computer Music Journal
articles, Dodge & Jerse and F. R. Moore
books.

Karplus-Strong and Physical Modelling are
implemented in Lisp.
