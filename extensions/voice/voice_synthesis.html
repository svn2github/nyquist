<h2>Usage:</h2>
In SAL mode:
<blockquote>
<pre>
load "voice/voice"
play vowel-n(1) ;; through vowel-n(18)
exec play-all-vowels() ;; automatically play them all
synthesise(f0, w1, w2, a, b, c, fm, h) - main voice synthesis function
; f0 = pitch frequency 
; w1 = amplitude of voicing source (min = 0.0 max = 1.0) 
; w2 = amplitude of noise source (min = 0.0 max = 1.0) 
; a = horizontal position of the tongue (0.0 = front -> 1.0 = back) 
; b = vertical position of the tongue (0.0 = low -> 1.0 = high) 
; c = rouding of the lips (0.0 = spread -> 1.0 = rounded) 
; fm = vibrato rate (in Hz) 
; h = duration in seconds 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Description</h2>

This singing voice synthesizer implements a geometrical articulator
for tongue position (vertical and horizontal position) and  
lips rouding. Four formants are modeled and driven with a table-lookup
pulse waveform with vibrato.

<h2>Demo</h2>
To hear some example sounds, try
<pre>load "voice/voice"
exec play-all-vowels()</pre>
