<h2>Usage:</h2>
See description below for details. For a quick demo, try this:
<pre>load "plight/drum.lsp"
play plight-drum-example()</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The drum machine software in <code>demos/plight</code> deserves further explanation. 
to use the software, load the code by evaluating:
<p><pre>
load "plight/drum.lsp"
exec load-props-file(strcat(*plight-drum-path*, 
                            "beats.props"))
exec create-drum-patches()
exec create-patterns()
</pre></p>

<p>
Drum sounds and patterns are specified in the <code>beats.props</code> file (or
whatever name you give to <code>load-props-file</code>). This file
contains two types of specifications. First, there are sound file specifications.
Sound files are located by a line of the form:
<p><pre>
set sound-directory = "./"
</pre></p>

This gives the name of the sound file directory, relative to the 
 <code>beats.props</code> file. Then, for each sound file, there should be a line of
the form:
<p><pre>
track.2.5 = big-tom-5.wav
</pre></p>

This says that on track 2, a velocity value of 5 means to play the sound file
 <code>big-tom-5.wav</code>. (Tracks and velocity values are described below.) 
The <code>beats.props</code> file contains specifications for all the sound files
in <code>plight</code> using 8 tracks. If you make your own specifications
file, tracks should be numbered consecutively from 1, and velocities should be
in the range of 1 to 9.
<p>
The second set of specifications is of beat patterns. A beat pattern is given
by a line in the following form:
<p><pre>
beats.5 = 2--32--43-4-5---
</pre></p>

The number after <code>beats</code> is just a pattern number. Each pattern
is given a unique number. After the equal sign, the digits and dashes are
velocity values where a dash means "no sound." Beat patterns should be
numbered consecutively from 1.
<p>
Once data is loaded, there are several functions to access drum patterns and 
create drum sounds (described below). The <code>plight/drum.lsp</code> file
contains an example function <code>play-drum-example()</code> to play some drums.
There is also the file <code>plight/beats.props</code> to serve as an
example of how to specify sound files and beat patterns.

<p>The following functions do not "autoload", so be sure to call
<pre>load "plight/drum.lsp"</pre>
in your main program to load the functions.
<p><dl><dt>
<code>drum(<a name="index1399"></a><i>tracknum</i>, <i>patternnum</i>, <i>bpm</i>)</code> [SAL]<br>

<code>(drum <i>tracknum</i> <i>patternnum</i> <i>bpm</i>)</code> [LISP]<dd>Create
a sound by playing drums sounds associated with track <i>tracknum</i> (a 
FIXNUM) using pattern <i>patternnum</i>. The tempo is given by <i>bpm</i> in
beats per minute. Normally patterns are a sequence of sixteenth notes, so
the tempo is in <i>sixteenth notes per minute</i>. For example,
if <i>patternnum</i> is 10,
then use the pattern specified for <code>beats.10</code>. If the third character
of this pattern is 3 and <i>tracknum</i> is 5, then on the third beat, play
the soundfile assigned to <code>track.5.3</code>. This function returns a <code>SOUND</code>.<br><br>
<dt><code>drum-loop(<i>snd</i>, <i>duration</i>, <i>numtimes</i>)</code> [SAL]<br>

<code>(drum-loop <i>snd</i> <i>duration</i> <i>numtimes</i>)</code> [LISP]<dd>Repeat the sound given by <i>snd</i> <i>numtimes</i> times. The repetitions occur at a time offset of <i>duration</i>, regardless of the actual duration of <i>snd</i>. A <code>SOUND</code> is returned.<br><br>
<dt><code>length-of-beat(</a><i>bpm</i>)</code> [SAL]<br>

<code>(length-of-beat <i>bpm</i>)</code> [LISP]<dd>Given a tempo of 
<i>bpm</i>, return the duration of the beat in seconds. Note that this software
has no real notion of beat. A "beat" is just the duration of each character
in the beat pattern strings. This function returns a <code>FLONUM</code>.
