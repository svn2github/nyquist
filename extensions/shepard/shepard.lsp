;; Description:
;
; The main function is SHEPTONE-SWEEP. Call it in SAL using:
;   sheptone-sweep(pitch-1, centerpitch-1, duration, pitch-2, centerpitch-2,
;                  overtonesemi, overtones, wavetable: *sine-table*)
; or in LISP:
;   (sheptone-sweep pitch-1 centerpitch-1 duration pitch-2 centerpitch-2
;                   overtonesemi overtones
;                   &optional (wavetable *sine-table*))
;
; (Note: this documentation is missing a description of the parameters and
; what they do, and a complete description of the algorithm. Contributions
; are welcome. -RBD)

; Some notes about how this works:
; Shepard tones consist of harmonics that are an octave apart, thus
; the ratios are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Note that the pitch is ambiguous
; in the sense that there could be a missing fundamental at 0.5, 0.25, etc.
; The other trick is that the spectral shape is constant. The amplitude
; of each harmonic is a function of its absolute frequency. Here, the
; shape is triangular so that as the frequency sweeps upward, harmonics
; (which are ramping up in frequency) fade in, reach a maximum, and fade out.
; 
; In this implementation, each harmonic is generated using an FM oscillator
; controlled by a frequency ramp. The harmonic is multiplied by an envelope
; to implement the spectral shape function. The envelope is computed by
; running the frequency control (with some scaling) into a SHAPE function
; that uses a triangular table to implement the spectral shape.
;
; Warning: Although I have not analyzed this code too carefully, I (RBD)
; believe that the oscillators keep sweeping up to higher and higher
; frequencies even after the amplitude drops to zero. This is not only
; wasteful, but when oscillators start to alias, they run slower. If you
; generate a very long Shepard tone with harmonics spanning many octaves,
; the run time could get to be very large. A better implementation would
; start the harmonics when they enter the non-zero part of the spectral
; envelope and end them when they leave it.
