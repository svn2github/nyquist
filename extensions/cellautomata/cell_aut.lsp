(defun compute-update-rule (rule a b c)
  ;; this is the most interesting part of the whole program
  ;; the rule has 8 bits. Use a, b, c to index the rule bits
  ;; and determine the result. To do this, we want a bit in 
  ;; the right position, e.g. if a=0,b=1,c=1, then the index
  ;; is 011 = 3, and we want a bit pattern with "1" in position 3:
  ;; 00001000. Note that this is 2^3 = a*2^4 + b*2^2 + c*2^1. So
  ;; we can test a, b, and c and multiply by 16, 4, and 2 to get
  ;; the right bit pattern. Then we can "and" it with rule to
  ;; get either zero or a non-zero as the result.
