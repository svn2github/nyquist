<h2>Usage:</h2>
In SAL mode:
<blockquote>
<pre>load "cellautomata/cell_aut.lsp" ;; you must load the file to use this extension
play cell-aut-demo() ;; play a demo
cell-aut(sound-object-list, duration, update-rule, iter) - main function, where
    sound-object-list is a list of expressions, one for each cell, and
        the expression is evaluated when the cell is "1"
    duration is the duration of each generation of the cellular automata
    update-rule is an integer describing how the next generation is computed; see
        the source code for details
    iter is the number of iterations (generations) to compute</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This extension harnesses the power of cellular automata for algorithmic
      composition. Cellular automata have been applied to graphics and
      visual patterns as well as music. In this work, the automaton
      consists of an array of boxes, where each box is initialized to
      either black or white (on/off, 0/1). At every step the next
      row/generation (represented visually as below the previous array)
      is computed from the first array using an update rule on each
      array element. An update rule (that defines the automaton itself)
      is simply a function from the array element's parent, and the
      parent's left and right neighbors. This concept is illustrated
      here: </p>
    <pre>	A1 A2 A3 ... 
	B1 B2 B3 ... </pre>
    <p>Let B2 be the element whose value is being computed. B2 is
      therefore dependent on the values of A1, A2, and A3 only. An
      example of an update rule would be:</p>
    <pre>if A1 = A3 and A2 = 1 then B2 = 1, else B2 = 0</pre>
    <p> There are 2 possible values for each of A1, A2, and A3 which
means there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations. And there are 2^8
= 256 possible functions from A1, A2, and A3 to B2. Therefore
there are only 256 possible update rules. Note that the number of
possible update rules is not dependent on the number of elements
in the array. The rules can be numbered from 0 to 255. To determine
the rule number, write the next-generation value for each
configuration (the state of three neighbors) in the previous
generation as shown near the top of the 
figure below. Then read off these outcomes to form a bit string:
00011110. Then convert this to a number: 00011110 = 30 base 10.
<p>In the figure below, rule 30 is used to generate a series of rows,
      starting with a single "one" in the first row.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="rule30.jpg" height="270"
        width="370"></p>
    <p>Instead of B1 = 1 indicating that a box be colored black and B1 =
      0 indicated that a box be colored white, in the music model this
      will correspond to turning certain sound objects on and off. For
      example, here we have an array of oscillators. </p>
    <pre>Osc 60 Osc 65 Osc 67 Osc 70 Osc 75 Osc 76 Osc 79</pre>
    <p> If only the 1st and 3rd elements are "turned on" this would
      result in the chord (sum (Osc 60) (Osc 67)). So each array, or
      level of the automata would correspond to a chord, and the chord
      progression would change over time as the automata developed. </p>
    <p>This feature very versatile, so the user can specify the basic
      sound array, the duration of each step, and which combining
      function to bring the activated sounds together. This design
      allows the user to use any expression to create sounds.</p>
    <p>The main function, <code>cell-aut</code>, takes the following
      parameters:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>an array of sound objects, specified using expressions to be
        evaluated</li>
      <li>the duration of each time step (also the duration for
        computing sound objects)</li>
      <li>the update rule to use on array evolution, specified by number
        (0 - 255)</li>
      <li>the number of iterations/generations the automata should allow
        itself to grow </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some interesting rules to try are Wolram's two most famous rules:
      30 (chaotic) and 90 (fractal patterns). </p>
    <h2>Algorithm Outline </h2>
    <p>Here is an outline of the algorithm implemented in <tt>cell-aut.lsp</tt>.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>create and initialize "current" and "previous" bit lists --
        these should have the same length as the sound array the user
        gave this function) -- potentially there could be a feature here
        allowing the user to specify the initial state of the array. </li>
      <li>create and initialize the list of sounds to return </li>
      <li>loop iter times
        <ol>
          <li>get the list of currently activated sounds from the
            "previous" bit list and extract the corresponding sounds
            from the sound array </li>
          <li>combine this set of sounds with the combining function
            (specified by the user), and add the resulting sound to the
            output list </li>
          <li>compute the "current" bit list from the "previous" bit
            list using the update rule iterated over all the elements --
            this wraps around so that endpoints are treated as being
            adjacent to each other </li>
          <li>set the "previous" bit array to the "current" bit array </li>
          <li>(end loop) </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>return the output list of sounds </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <p>The file <code><a href="cell_aut.lsp">lib/cellautomata/cell_aut.lsp</a></code>
      includes the function <code>cell-aut-demo</code> which is
    equivalent to the following:</p>
    <pre>function cell-aut-demo()
  exec require-from(piano-note-2, "pianosyn.lsp")
  return cell-aut(cell-aut-major-scale(), 0.2, 30, 80) * 0.5</pre>
    <p>so you can run this to hear an example output:</p>
    <pre>play cell-aut-demo()</pre>
