<h2>Usage:</h2>
In SAL mode:
<blockquote>
<pre>
load "rhythm/rhythm.sal"
exec rhythm-all()
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This example illustrates a very simple percussion sound created
      with noise and using the sound to generate a rhythm.</p>
    <p>The sound is created by filtering noise. The filter is controlled
      using the piece-wise linear function <code>pwl</code>. Examples
      here are in SAL syntax followed by Lisp syntax in small print:</p>
    <pre>function pulse(dur)
  return hp(noise(),
            pwl(0, 15, 0.2, 6000, 0.6, 15000, 0.75, 7)) ~ dur
</pre><pre><small><small>(defun pulse (dur)
  (stretch dur (hp (noise) (pwl 0 15 0.2 6000 0.6 15000 0.75 7))))</small></small></pre>
<p>A sequence of sounds is constructed and repeated in the following
      code. Notice that
      each time through the pattern, the scale factor is increased by 0.1, giving the whole sequence a
      crescendo:</p>
    <pre>function pulsepat(rep) 
  return seqrep(i, rep, i * 0.1 *
                seq(pulse(1), pulse(1), pulse(2), pulse(2))) ~ 0.2

play pulsepat(17)
<br><small><small>(defun pulsepat (rep) 
  (seqrep (i rep)
    (stretch 0.2
      (scale (* i 0.1)
        (seq (pulse 1) (pulse 1) (pulse 2) (pulse 2))))))

(play (pulsepat 17))</small></small></pre>
<h2>Pitched Patterns</h2>
    <p>This example uses the <code>electrobass</code> function. With the
      right pitch parameter, we hear a kind of electronic bass sound. Try this:</p>
    <pre>play electrobass(0.4, 30, 1.2)
</pre><pre><small><small>(play (electrobass 0.4 30 1.2))</small></small></pre>
<p>These notes can be combined to create a pattern. The <code>techno</code>
      function
      creates a short pattern of 3 notes repeated any number of times:</p>
    <pre>function techno(rep)
  return seqrep(i, rep, 0.8 *
                sim(0.8 * electrobass(0.4, 30, 1.2) @ 0,
                    0.6 * electrobass(0.2, 30, 0.9) @ 0.2,
	            0.7 * electrobass(0.1, 30, 1.1) @ 0.3))
<br><small><small>(defun techno (rep)
  (seqrep (i rep) 
    (scale 0.8
      (sim
	(scale 0.8 (at 0.0 (electrobass 0.4 30 1.2)))
	(scale 0.6 (at 0.2 (electrobass 0.2 30 0.9)))
	(scale 0.7 (at 0.3 (electrobass 0.1 30 1.1)))
))))</small></small></pre>
<p>Try this:</p><pre>play techno(3)</pre>

    
<pre><small><small>(play (techno 3))</small></small></pre>

    
The following combines and transposes rhythmic segments to create
      a bass line:
    <pre>play seqrep(i, 2, seq(techno(2),
                      transpose(5, techno(2)),
                      transpose(-2, techno(1)),
                      transpose(3, techno(1)),
                      techno(2)))
</pre>
<pre><small><small>(play (seqrep (i 2)
        (seq (techno 2)
             (transpose 5 (techno 2))
             (transpose -2 (techno 1))
             (transpose 3 (techno 1))
(techno 2))))</small></small></pre>
<h3>Layers for Richer Texture</h3>
    <p>Sounds can often be combined with time and pitch offsets to
      create richer textures. The
      following layers two sequences are based on the same <code>techno</code>
      function:</p>
    <pre>play sim(0.4 * seqrep(i, 2,
                      seq(techno(2),
                          transpose(5, techno(2)),
                          transpose(-2, techno(1)),
                          transpose(3, techno(1)),
                          techno(2))) @ 0,
         0.2 * seqrep(i, 2,
                      seq(transpose(2, techno 2))
                          transpose(7, techno(2))
                          transpose(-4, techno(1))
                          transpose(5, techno(1))
                          transpose(-2, techno(2)))) @ 0.1)
</pre>
<pre><small><small>(play (sim
        (scale 0.4
          (at 0.0
            (seqrep (i 2)
              (seq (techno 2)
                   (transpose 5 (techno 2))
                   (transpose -2 (techno 1))
                   (transpose 3 (techno 1))
                   (techno 2)))))
	(scale 0.2
          (at 0.1
            (seqrep (i 2)
              (seq (transpose 2 (techno 2))
                   (transpose 7 (techno 2))
                   (transpose -4 (techno 1))
                   (transpose 5 (techno 1))
                   (transpose -2 (techno 2)))) ))))</small></small></pre>
<p>Note that the second layer is almost but not exactly a
      transposition of the first
      layer. If it were an exact transposition, it would make sense to
      encapsulate the first
      layer in a function and call it twice. The following variation is
      much more concise, but
      it does not compute exactly the same sound:</p>
    <pre>function bass-line()
  return seqrep(i, 2,<br>                seq(techno(2),
                transpose(5, techno(2)),
                transpose(-2, techno(1)),
                transpose(3, techno(1)),
                techno(2))

    
play sim(0.4 * bass-line(),
         0.2 * transpose(2, bass-line()) @ 0.1)

    
</pre>
<pre><small><small>(defun bass-line ()
  (seqrep (i 2)
    (seq (techno 2)
         (transpose 5 (techno 2))
         (transpose -2 (techno 1))
         (transpose 3 (techno 1))
         (techno 2))))</small></small></pre>
<pre><small><small>(play (sim (scale 0.4 (bass-line))
           (scale 0.2 
             (at 0.1 (transpose 2 (bass-line))))))</small></small></pre>
<h2>Another Example</h2>
    <p>This example also uses the <code>electrobass</code> function.</p>
    <pre>play seqrep(i, 17, 
            lp((i * 0.05 + 0.3) * 
               seq(transpose(-4, electrobass(0.1, 32, 0.6)), 
                   transpose(-5, electrobass(0.05, 20, 0.2)),
                   transpose(2 * i, electrobass(0.1, 27, 0.5)), 
                   transpose(-3, electrobass(0.05, 22, 0.1)), 
                   transpose(i * 3, electrobass(0.1, 28, 0.4)), 
                   electrobass(0.05, 31, 0.7)),
               100 * i))

</pre>
<pre><small><small>(play (seqrep (i 17) 
        (lp (scale (+ (* i 0.05 ) 0.3) 
              (seq (transpose -4 (electrobass 0.1 32 0.6)) 
                   (transpose -5 (electrobass 0.05 20 0.2)) 
                   (transpose i (electrobass 0.1 27 0.5)) 
                   (transpose -3 (electrobass 0.05 22 0.1)) 
                   (transpose i (electrobass 0.1 28 0.4)) 
                   (electrobass 0.05 31 0.7)))
            (* 100 i))))</small></small></pre>
<p>This play 17 repetitions of a sound. Each time, the sound is a
      bit louder, the low-pass
      frequency is raised by 300 Hz, and two of the transpositions are
      increased. This creates a
      rhythmic and evolving sound.</p>
