<h1>Extension Template Example with HTML Documentation</h1>
<h3>Extension name: <code>ext-template1</code></h3>
<p><i>This extension is intended only to illustrate how to create an extension. </i>
<hr>
<!-- Version: 1.0; (version for extension metadata, do not change) -->
Author Name: Azarakhsh Keipour and Roger B. Dannenberg;<br>
Author Email: akeipour@andrew.cmu.edu and rbd@cs.cmu.edu;<br>
<br>
Additional File: c4-player.sal;<br>
Additional File: piano-player.sal;<br>
Additional File: pluck-player.sal;<br>
Additional File: autoload.lsp;<br>
Additional File: nyquistwords.txt;<br>
<!-- End Metadata -->

<h2>Usage:</h2>
In SAL mode:
<blockquote>
<pre>
exec play-piano-c4() 
exec play-pluck-c4() 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This example uses an HTML file as the "root" of the extension. This is 
the preferred format when there is separate documentation and code.

<p>This file is parsed by the Extension Manager of the NyquistIDE up 
to the line containing "End Metadata" (which in this file is inside 
an HTML comment).

<p>The parser looks for:
<ul><li>"Version 1.0", which is the version of the extension file format, 
<i>not</i> the version of the extension. To avoid confusing users, this
string appears inside an HTML comment.
    <li>"Additional File:", which indicates the installer should install 
      an additional file. 
  <ul>
    <li>The additional file name is a path relative to the URL for this file.
    <li>The file name <i>must</i> be terminated with a semicolon (;) 
        or newline (&lt;br&gt; or other HTML tags will be parsed as part
        of the file name).
    <li>There may be any number of additional files listed.
  </ul>
    <li>"Author Name:" and "Author Email:" fields are recommended, but not 
      currently parsed by the Extension Manager.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functions</h2>
This section describes the functions and global variables (if any)
that are provided by this extension. Notice in the HTML source code
of this file that each definition is named using an HTML anchor, e.g.
<code>&lt;a name=play-piano-c4&gt;</code> before the definition of
<code>play-piano-c4()</code>.

<h3>Completion List Processing</h3>
<p>There is an optional additional extension file named <code>nyquistwords.txt</code>
that is parsed by NyquistIDE when it starts. The words in that file
are added to the IDE Completion List system so that users can see
these functions as completions. Users can also click on the
completions to find documentation.
<p>The <code><a href=nyquistwords.txt>nyquistwords.txt</a></code> for
this extension contains:
<blockquote>
<pre>
play-piano-c4 ) 
ext-template1/ext-template1.html#play-piano-c4 
play-pluck-c4 ) 
ext-template1/ext-template1.html#play-pluck-c4 
</pre>
</blockquote>
The meaning is as follows: Entries are pairs of lines. The first line
of each pair gives the name to appear in the completion list. If the
name is a function, follow the function name with a space, a list of
parameters (possibly empty as in this case) and end with a close
parenthesis ")". (There is no open parenthesis.) For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>eq-highshelf signal hz gain [slope])</pre>
</blockquote>
describes the <code>eq-highshelf</code> function which takes 3
required positional and one optional parameters.
<p>The second line of each pair is a URL, starting with the template
name. Notice that the URL includes the anchor that directs the browser
to exactly the definition of the function or variable. The NyquistIDE
will complete the URL based on the location of the local copies of
extensions (which will be in the <code>lib</code> directory.)
<p>If you install this extension (<code>ext-template1</code>), and
start to type "play-pian..." you will see <code>play-piano-c4()</code>
in the Completion List.

<h3>Sample Function Documentation</h3>

<dl>
  <a name=play-piano-c4>
    <dt><code>play-piano-c4()</code> [SAL]</dt>
    <dd>play a C4 note on the piano synthesizer.</dd>
  </a>
  <a name=play-pluck-c4>
    <dt><code>play-pluck-c4()</code> [SAL]</dt>
    <dd>play a C4 note on the pluck synthesizer.</dd>
  </a>
</dl>

<h2>Autoload Facility</h2>
Nyquist had many built-in functions, so users may be confused if they
have to explicitly load extensions. On the other hand, loading
<i>all</i> extensions at start-up will make loading slower and use
more memory. A compromise is autoloading, where stubs are loaded to
load real functions the first time the stub is called. The actual
implementations overwrite the stubs so the next time the stub is
called, no loading is needed or even checked.

<p>To enable autoloading, simply add the file
<code>autoload.lsp</code> to your files. Notice above that 
<code>autoload.lsp</code> is one of the &ldquo;Additional
Files.&rdquo; 

<p>The <code>autoload.txt</code> file for this extension is:
<blockquote><pre>
;; autoload the ext-template1 functions 
(autoload "c4-player.sal" 'play-piano-c4 'play-pluck-c4) 
</pre></blockquote>

This is a Lisp expression. The <code>autoload</code> function is
built-in, and the first parameter is the (double-quoted) name of the
file to load to load the extension. Note that there is no path (it
will be loaded relative to the extension directory.)

<p>The remaining parameters are simply the names of (some of) the
functions that are declared by this extension. Any function on this
list will be defined as a stub that loads the extension when the stub
is called the first time. Note the use of the single quote.


<p>Notice that
<ol><li>There are no commas separating parameters. This is
  how Lisp syntax works;</li>
  <li>Function names have a single quote
prefix. This denotes a symbol, one of Lisp's built-in types. Do no
even think about a double quote, &ldquo;closing&rdquo; the single
quote, or any other syntax.</li></ol>

<p>If you autoload functions, your "Usage" instructions near the top
of the file should probably not say anything about loading.

<p>If you do <i>not</i> autoload functions, your "Usage" instructions
in this extension would probably mention the <code>load</code>
command, i.e.:
<blockquote><pre>
load "ext-template1/c4-player.sal"
exec play-piano-c4() 
exec play-pluck-c4() 
</pre></blockquote>
In this case, it is important to include the name of the extension in
the path. Simply loading <code>"c4-player.sal"</code> will not work
because <code>ext-template1</code> is not on Nyquist's load
path. However, <code>lib</code> is on the load path, and
<code>ext-template1</code> is in <code>lib</code>, so
<code>"ext-template1/c4-player.sal"</code> will work.
