<p>
The <code>moog.lsp</code> library gives the Nyquist user easy access to "classic"
synthesizer sounds through an emulation of the Minimoog Synthesizer.
Unlike modular Moogs that were very large, the Minimoog was the first
successful and commonly used portable synthesizer. The trademark filter attack
was unique and easily recognizable. The goal of this Nyquist instrument is not
only to provide the user with default sounds, but also to give control over
many of the "knobs" found on the Minimoog. In this implementation, these
parameters are controlled using keywords. The input to the <code>moog</code> 
instrument is a user-defined sequence of notes, durations, and articulations
that simulate notes played on a keyboard. These are translated into 
control voltages that drive multiple oscillators, similar to the Voltage
Controlled Oscillator or VCO found in the original analog Moog.
<p>
The basic functionality of the Minimoog has been implemented, including the
often-used "glide". The glide feature essentially low-pass filters the control
voltage sequence in order to create sweeps between notes. 
Figure <a href = "#202">1</a> is a simplified schematic of the data flow in the Moog. 
The control lines have been omitted.

The most recognizable feature of the Minimoog is its resonant filter, a 
Four-Pole Ladder Filter invented by Robert Moog. It is simply implemented 
in a circuit with four transistors and provides an outstanding 24 dB/octave 
rolloff. It is modeled here using the built-in Nyquist resonant filter. 
One of the Moog filter features is a constant Q, or center frequency to 
bandwidth ratio. This is implemented and the user can control the Q. 
<p>
The user can control many parameters using keywords. Their default values,
acceptable ranges, and descriptions are shown below. The defaults were
obtained by experimenting with the official Minimoog software synthesizer
by Arturia.
<p>
<a name = "203"><h4>Oscillator Parameters and Default Values</h4></a>
<p><pre>
range-osc1: 2
range-osc2: 1
range-osc3: 3
</pre></p>

These parameters control the octave of each oscillator. A value of 1
corresponds to the octave indicated by the input note. A value of 3
is two octaves above the fundamental. The allowable range is 1 to 7.
<p>
<p><pre>
detun2: -.035861
detun3: .0768
</pre></p>

Detuning of two oscillators adds depth to the sound. A value of 1 corresponds
to an increase of a single semitone and a -1 corresponds to a decrease
in a semitone. The range is -1 to 1.
<p>
<p><pre>
shape-osc1: *saw-table*
shape-osc2: *saw-table*
shape-osc3: *saw-table*
</pre></p>

Oscilators can use any wave shape. The default sawtooth waveform is
a built-in Nyquist variable. Other waveforms can be defined by the user.
<p>
<p><pre>
volume-osc1: 1
volume-osc2: 1
volume-osc3: 1
</pre></p>

These parameters control the relative volume of each oscillator. The range
is any <code>FLONUM</code> greater than or equal to zero.
<p>
<a name = "204"><h4>Noise Parameters and Default Values</h4></a>
<p><pre>
noiselevel: .05
</pre></p>

This parameter controls the relative volume of the noise source. The range
is any <code>FLONUM</code> greater than or equal to zero.
	
<a name = "205"><h4>Filter Parameters and Default Values</h4></a>
<p><pre>
filter-cutoff: 768
</pre></p>

The cutoff frequency of the filter in given in Hz. The range is zero
to 20,000 Hz.
<p>
<p><pre>
Q: 2
</pre></p>

Q is the ratio of center frequency to bandwidth. It is held constant by
making the bandwidth a function of frequency. The range is any
<code>FLONUM</code> greater than zero.
<p>
<p><pre>
contour: .65
</pre></p>

Contour controls the range of the transient frequency sweep from a high
to low cutoff frequency when a 	note is played. The high frequency is
proportional to contour. A contour of 0 removes this sweep. The range
is 0 to 1.
<p>
<p><pre>
filter-attack: .0001
</pre></p>

Filter attack controls the attack time of the filter, i.e. the time to
reach the high cutoff frequency. The range is any <code>FLONUM</code> greater
than zero (seconds).
<p>
<p><pre>
filter-decay: .5
</pre></p>

Filter decay controls the decay time of the filter, i.e. the time of the
sweep from the high to low cutoff frequency. The range is 
any <code>FLONUM</code> greater than zero (seconds).
<p>
<p><pre>
filter-sustain: .8
</pre></p>

Filter sustain controls the percentage of the filter cutoff frequency that
the filter settles on following the sweep. The range is 0 to 1.
	
<a name = "206"><h4>Amplitude Parameters and Default Values</h4></a>
<p><pre>
amp-attack: .01
</pre></p>

This parameter controls the amplitude envelope attack time, i.e. the time to
reach maximum amplitude. The range is 
any <code>FLONUM</code> greater than zero (seconds).
<p>
<p><pre>
amp-decay: 1
</pre></p>

This parameter controls the amplitude envelope decay time, i.e. the time
between the maximum and sustain volumes. The range is
any <code>FLONUM</code> greater than zero (seconds).
<p>
<p><pre>
amp-sustain: 1
</pre></p>

This parameter controls the amplitude envelope sustain volume, a fraction
of the maximum. The range is 0 to 1.
<p>
<p><pre>
amp-release: 0
</pre></p>

This parameter controls the amplitude envelope release time, i.e. the time
it takes between the sustain volume and 0 once the note ends. 
The duration controls the overall length of the sound. The range of <code>amp-release</code> is any <code>FLONUM</code> greater than zero (seconds).
<p>
<a name = "207"><h4>Other Parameters and Default Values</h4></a>
<p><pre>
glide: 0
</pre></p>

Glide controls the low-pass filter on the control voltages. This models the
glide knob on a Minimoog. A higher value corresponds to a lower cutoff
frequency and hence a longer "glide" between notes. A value of 0
corresponds to no glide. The range is zero to 10.
<p>
<a name = "208"><h4>Input Format</h4></a>
A single note or a series of notes can be input to the Moog instrument
by defining a list with the following format:
<p><pre>
list(list(<i>frequency</i>, <i>duration</i>, <i>articulation</i>), <span style="font-style:normal">...</span> )
</pre></p>

where <i>frequency</i> is a <code>FLONUM</code> in steps, <i>duration</i> is the duration
of each note in seconds (regardless of the release time of the amplifier), 
and <i>articulation</i> is a percentage of the duration that a sound will be
played, representing the amount of time that a key is pressed. The filter 
and amplitude envelopes are only triggered if a note is played when
the articulation of the previous note is less than 1, or a key is not down at
the same time. This Moog instrument is a monophonic instrument, so only
one note can sound at a time. The release section of the amplifier is
triggered when the articulation is less than 1 at the time 
(<i>duration</i> * <i>articulation</i>).
