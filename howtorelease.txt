How to release Nyquist (notes from RBD to RBD):

Note: releases are now on sourceforge. The file names are
      nyqosx30n.tgz
      nyqsrc30n.zip
      setupnyqiderun30n.exe

New primitives should be entered into misc\transfiles.lsp
and then makefile.lsp should be used to generate a new
Makefile as well as sndfn.cl and sndfn.wcl. Run intgen
under Windows (or Mac) using intgen @sndfn.wcl

(Alternatively, with the new CMake files, the XLISP_C_Interfaces
project will build the interface files. You should check that they
appear in the right place or if not they should be manually copied.)

ON EITHER WINDOWS OR MAC

Edit Readme.txt to contain correct version number at top.

Add changes to Readme.txt changelog.

Edit runtime/nyinit.lsp to contain correct version number.

Edit documentation to contain correct version number.

Is documentation current and installed?
[Update and Commit via SVN]

To rebuild documentation:
    cd docsrc/s2h
    . render-latex.sh -- will run init.lsp which runs
         scribe-to-html-and-latex. Pay close attention
         to output for missing labels or changed
         nyquistman.out or errors. Fix errors if needed.
         Rerun pdflatex and/or makeindex if needed to get
         labels right.
    mv nyquistman.pdf ../../doc
    cd ../..
    mv doc/NyquistWords.txt to jnyqide/NyquistWords.txt

SVN commit -- documentation?

ON WINDOWS AND MAC

copy the documentation from d:/rbd/nyquist to AFS, or
    scp /Users/rbd/nyquist/doc/* rbd@linux.gp.cs.cmu.edu:www/doc/nyquist/

ON WINDOWS

Make release version of nyquist
run comp-ide.bat to build NyquistIDE
Run releasenyqide.bat to create release directory.
Run Inno Setup 5/Inno Setup Compiler
Select C:\Users\rbd\nyquist\sys\win\nyqrelide.iss
Update the version number in the code and save it
Possibly set the SourceDir in [setup] and save it
Select Build:Compile

move nyquist\setup\setupnyqiderun.exe setupnyqiderunNNN.exe
  , using the version number for NNN

Visit https://frs.sourceforge.net/webupload and upload setupnyqiderunNNN.exe

FOR THE MAC

in XCode, choose ny target and Product > Build For > Archiving
  result should end up in /Users/rbd/nyquist/macosxproject/build/Release/ny
copy result to jnyqide/ny  

in XCode, choose NyquistIDE target and Product > Build For > Archiving
  result should end up in /Users/rbd/nyquist/jnyqide/NyquistIDE.app

run NyquistIDE.app just to make sure it works: cd jnyqide; open NyquistIDE.app

cd ..  -- back to the top-level nyquist directory
source misc/cmu/cmuinstallmac.sh

FOR PLIGHT DRUM MACHINE -- SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY

(this is a separate download because it is large)
source install-plight.sh

FOR THE MAC TO BUILD RELEASE FOR UNIX

source release is built along with Mac release by cmuinstallmac.sh

******************************************************
* OLD INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTOMATIC RELEASE TO CMU WEB: *
******************************************************

ON WINDOWS

Run release.bat to create release directory for nyquist_setup
Run Setup Generator and select nyquist_setup
Make sure Files:Source Directory is set to proper nyqrel just created by release.bat
Click Make

Run releasenyqwin.bat to create release directory for nyqwin_setup
Run Setup Generator and select nyqwin_setup
Make sure Files:Source Directory is set to proper nyqrelwin just created by releasenyqwin.bat
Click Make

... releasenyqide.bat ...

from the nyquist directory:
make sure nyquist/ny exists for execution by misc/cmu/cmuinstall.sh
    (copy it to nyquist/ny if not)
cd misc/cmu
run cmuinstall.bat or source cmuinstall.sh

IGNORE THIS -- DELETE AFTER VERSION 3.02
same thing on PPC, but use
cd ~/nyquist/misc/cmu
bash cmuinstallmac.sh
--- and use something like 232ppc for the version number

FOR THE MAC TO BUILD RELEASE FOR UNIX

the cmuinstall.sh file builds a source zip file and installs it
