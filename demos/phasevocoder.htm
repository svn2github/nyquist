    <h1>Phase Vocoder Tutorial </h1>
    <p><b>Roger B. Dannenberg</b></p>
    <p>This page describes how to use the phase vocoder in Nyquist. The
      phasevocoder is used for time stretching a signal without changing
      the pitch, and it can be combined with resampling to change both
      time and pitch independently.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The phase vocoder function is <tt>phasevocoder</tt>, which is
      called as follows:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>phasevocoder(input, map, fftsize, hopsize, mode)<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    where <tt>input</tt> is the input sound, <tt>map</tt> is a map
    from output time to input time, <tt>fftsize</tt> is the number of
    samples to use in the analysis, <tt>hopsize</tt> is the step size
    for use in synthesis, and <tt>mode</tt> controls the synthesis
    algorithm. Only the first two parameters are required. These
    parameters will be explained further below.<br>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>A phase vocoder works by analyzing the input signal using the
      FFT, which decomposes the signal into frequency components. The
      basic assumption is that the input signal consists of sinusoids
      (no impulses) and that the FFT can resolve these sinusoids into
      separate components.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The phase vocoder is similar to granular synthesis in that the
      input is broken into short grains of sound which are reassembled
      to create an output sound. In the phase vocoder, the output signal
      is always constructed from equally spaced grains. To achieve time
      stretching, the spacing of the grains extracted from the input is
      variable. If grains are taken with higher amounts of overlap, the
      resulting output is longer so the input is apparently stretched.
      If grains have less overlap in the input sound, the input will
      sound speeded up.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The distinctive aspect of the phase vocoder is that when grains
      are assembled into the output, the phase of each frequency
      component is adjusted to avoid phase cancellation. Normally, if
      the spacing of grains is changed from input to output, different
      frequencies will be shifted by different amounts of phase. Some
      will add constructively and some will add destructively. Thus,
      some frequencies will be emphasized over others, often creating a
      buzz at grain rate. The phase vocoder attempts to eliminate this
      artifact by adjusting all phases to be coherent.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>The Parameters</h2>
    <tt>input</tt> is the input sound. It can be any mono sound.<br>
    <br>
    <tt>map</tt> is also a sound type, but it is a control function that
    maps output to input. For example, if we want to stretch a sound by
    a factor of two with a result that has a duration of 6 seconds, we
    should make a control function that is 6 seconds long (the output
    duration is determined by the duration of <tt>map</tt>). This <tt>map</tt>
    function should increase from 0 to 3 (because if we stretch by a
    factor of two, output time 6 will correspond to input time 6). Thus,
    the <tt>map</tt> parameter could be <tt>pwl(6, 3, 6)</tt> or <tt>ramp(6)


      * 3</tt>.<br>
    <br>
    <tt>fftsize</tt> is the size of the analysis and synthesis grains.
    This number must be a power of 2. The default is 2048. Smaller
    values give less smearing, especially at onsets or percussive sounds
    that do not meet the sinusoidal content assumption. Larger values
    give more accurate analysis, especially with dense spectra that do
    not meet the "FFT can resolve these sinusoids into separate
    components" assumption.<br>
    <br>
    <tt>hopsize</tt> defaults to <tt>fftsize / 8</tt>. The hopsize
    should be chosen to be at most <tt>fftsize / 4</tt>, should be a
    power of 2, and should be less than <tt>fftsize * stretchfactor / 3</tt>.&nbsp;



    E.g. if the stretch factor is 0.25 (output sounds 4 times as fast as
    the input), <tt>hopsize</tt> should be decreased to <tt>fftsize /
      16</tt>.<tt><br>
      <br>
    </tt><tt>mode</tt> is an integer that controls some algorithmic
    details. The default is <tt>0</tt> which gives a standard phase
    vocoder. The value 1 uses an alternative computation for phase
    adjustments that preserves the phase relationship between spectral
    peaks and nearby bins. The value 2 produces a "robot voice" effect
    where phase is fixed in each grain, creating a vocoder-like effect.<br>
    <h2> Example</h2>
    <p>Read the audio from <tt>demos/audio/happy.wav</tt> and stretch
      the first 4 seconds by a factor of 4 so that the output duration
      is 16 seconds:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>function test9()
  begin
    with inp = s-read("../audio/happy.wav")
    play phasevocoder(inp, pwlv(0, 16, 4))
  end
</pre>
    <h2>Time and Pitch Manipulation</h2>
    <p>The <tt>pv-time-pitch</tt> function can be used to
      simultaneously stretch and pitch shift an input signal. It shifts
      pitch by resampling after phase vocoding. E.g. by stretching by a
      factor of two and then resampling by a factor of two, the input
      can be raised one octave in pitch without changing the duration.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The parameters are:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><tt>pv-time-pitch(input, stretchfn, pitchfn, dur,<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fftsize,


          hopsize, mode)<br>
        </tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where <tt>input</tt> is the input sound to be altered, <tt>stretchfn</tt>
      controls stretching, <tt>pitchfn</tt> controls pitch shifting, <tt>dur</tt>
      is the approximate duration, and the remaining parameters are
      optional parameters passed to the <tt>phasevocoder</tt> function.<br>
    </p>
    <p><tt>stretchfn</tt> and <tt>pitchfn</tt> work differently from
      the <tt>map</tt> parameter passed to <tt>phasevocoder</tt>. <tt>stretchfn</tt>
      gives the amount by which the input should be stretched at each
      point in time.&nbsp; Thus, if you want the input at time 3.1 to be
      stretched by a factor of 1.5, the value of <tt>stretchfn</tt> at
      time 3.1 should be 1.5. Similarly, <tt>pitchfn</tt> is the pitch
      shift amount (a frequency multiplier) to use at each point of time
      in the input. If the pitch should be unaltered, the function value
      should be 1. To raise the pitch, use values greater than 1 (e.g. 2
      means go up by one octave).<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>In this example, we will alter a familiar tune, Happy Birthday,
      to another familiar tune, Twinkle Twinkle, using <tt>pv-time-pitch</tt>.
      To begin, I downloaded a rendition of Happy Birthday from YouTube.
      (Credit: Artist is unknown, but the URL is <tt>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRJQ3QxLjG0</tt>).
Next,


      I used Audacity to extract a segment of the music and save it to <tt>demos/audio/happy.wav</tt>.
      I also labeled each syllable with a label track in Audacity and
      exported the labels to <tt>demos/audio/labels.txt</tt><i>. </i></p>
    <p><i> </i></p>
    <p>Let's work on <tt>stretchfn</tt> first. We want to make the
      rhythm mostly quarter notes. For simplicity, let's make the tempo
      120, so each quarter note is 0.5s. The stretch factor for a note
      of length x to become length 0.5 will be 0.5/x. Thus, we need to
      construct <tt>stretchfn</tt> to have a constant stretch factor
      for each note, where the stretch factor is 0.5/(t2 - t1) where t2
      is the time of the next note and t1 is the time of the note to be
      stretched, i.e. (t2 - t1) is the duration.<br>
    </p>
    <p>We'll get the note times from the labels file:<br>

    I assigned each time to a short local variable to make the
    calculations simpler (although I probably could have created an
    array and automated things a bit more):<br>
    <pre>    with h1 = 0.000000,
         p1 = 0.166198, 
         b1 = 0.369078,
         d1 = 1.085618,
         t1 = 1.733822,
         y1 = 2.209605,
         h2 = 3.578676,
         p2 = 3.857731,
         b2 = 4.055933,
         d2 = 4.776379,
         t2 = 5.425378,
         y2 = 5.905255,
         h3 = 7.271426,
         p3 = 7.550667,
         b3 = 7.746811,
         d3 = 8.494934
</pre>
    Next, I calculate stretch factors for each note, being careful to
    make notes 7 and 14 half notes (using 1.0 instead of 0.5 as the
    target duration):<br>
    <pre>         u1 = 0.5 / (p1 - h1),
         u2 = 0.5 / (b1 - p1),
         u3 = 0.5 / (d1 - b1),
         u4 = 0.5 / (t1 - d1),
         u5 = 0.5 / (y1 - t1),
         u6 = 0.5 / (h2 - y1),
         u7 = 1.0 / (p2 - h2),
         u8 = 0.5 / (b2 - p2),
         u9 = 0.5 / (d2 - b2),
         u10 = 0.5 / (t2 - d2),
         u11 = 0.5 / (y2 - t2),
         u12 = 0.5 / (h3 - y2),
         u13 = 0.5 / (p3 - h3),
         u14 = 1.0 / (b3 - p3)   
</pre>
    Next, I create the <tt>stretchfn</tt> using <tt>pwlv</tt>. This is
    a little awkward because to obtain steps in the function, each time
    point must have a time and value for the previous note, then the
    same time but a new value for the next note, creating a step in the
    function:<br>
    <pre>    set *stretch* = pwlv(    u1, p1, u1, p1, u2, b1, u2,
                         b1, u3, d1, u3, d1, u4, t1, u4,
                         t1, u5, y1, u5, y1, u6, h2, u6,
                         h2, u7, p2, u7, p2, u8, b2, u8,
                         b2, u9, d2, u9, d2, u10, t2, u10,
                         t2, u11, y2, u11, y2, u12, h3, u12,
                         h3, u13, p3, u13, p3, u14, b3, u14)
</pre>
    The function is assigned to a global variable. This is not generally
    recommended, but it will make it easy for us to plot and inspect the
    function when debugging.<br>
    <br>
    Next, we construct the <tt>pitchfn</tt> based on the difference in
    pitch between the two melodies. Let's write out the melodies
    side-by-side using step numbers (only relative pitch matters here):<br>
    <pre>    67 Hap   60 Twin
    67 py    60 kle
    69 Birth 67 Twin
    67 Day   67 kle

</pre>
    <p>We'll need another function similar to <tt>*stretch*</tt> only
      using the pitch differences to create a transposition amount.
      Let's make <tt>v1</tt> through <tt>v14</tt> and substitute for <tt>u1</tt>
      through <tt>u14</tt> to make another <tt>pwl</tt> function.</p>
    <p>Here are the v<i>n</i> variables, based on the numbers above
      (pairs are reversed, e.g. to go from the 67 “Hap” to 60 “Twin,” we
      call <tt>to-ratio(67, 60)</tt>), the function <tt>to-ratio</tt>,
      and finally, the pitch control function: </p>
    <pre>         v1 = to-ratio(60, 67),
         v2 = to-ratio(60, 67),
         v3 = to-ratio(67, 69),
         v4 = to-ratio(67, 67),
         v5 = to-ratio(69, 72),
         v6 = to-ratio(69, 71),
         v7 = to-ratio(67, 67),
         v8 = to-ratio(65, 67),
         v9 = to-ratio(65, 69),
         v10 = to-ratio(64, 67),
         v11 = to-ratio(64, 74),
         v12 = to-ratio(62, 72),
         v13 = to-ratio(62, 67),
         v14 = to-ratio(60, 67)

function to-ratio(a, b) return step-to-hz(a) / step-to-hz(b)

    set *pitch* = pwlv(    v1, p1, v1, p1, v2, b1, v2,
                       b1, v3, d1, v3, d1, v4, t1, v4,
                       t1, v5, y1, v5, y1, v6, h2, v6,
                       h2, v7, p2, v7, p2, v8, b2, v8,
